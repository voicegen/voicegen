<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p> Speech conveys more information than text, as the same word can be uttered in various voices to convey diverse information. Compared to traditional text-to-speech (TTS) methods relying on speech prompts (reference speech) for voice variability, using text prompts (descriptions) is more user-friendly since speech prompts can be hard to find or may not exist at all. TTS approaches based on the text prompt face two main challenges: 1) the one-to-many problem, where not all details about voice variability can be described in the text prompt, and 2) the limited availability of text prompt datasets, where vendors and large cost of data labeling are required to write text prompts for speech. In this work, we introduce VoiceGen to address these challenges with a variation network to provide variability information of voice not captured by text prompts, and a prompt generation pipeline to utilize the large language models (LLM) to compose high quality text prompts. Specifically, the variation network predicts the representation extracted from the reference speech (which contains full information about voice) based on the (text) prompt representation. For the prompt generation pipeline, it generates text prompts for speech with a speech language understanding model to recognize voice attributes (e.g., gender, speed) from speech and a large language model to formulate text prompts based on the recognition results. Experiments on a large-scale (44K hours) speech dataset demonstrate that compared to the previous works, VoiceGen generates voices more consistent with text prompts and supports the sampling of diverse voice variability, thereby offering users more choices on voice generation. Additionally, the prompt generation pipeline produces high-quality text prompts, eliminating the large labeling cost. The demo page of VoiceGen is available online. </p>

<h2 id="dataset">1. Dataset</h2>
<p> Given that there are no TTS datasets with prompts, we construct and release a dataset called PromptSpeech which consists of speech and the corresponding prompts. We synthesize speech with 5 different style factors (gender, pitch, speaking speed, volume, and emotion) from a commercial TTS <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-to-speech/#overview">API</a>. The emotion factor has 5 categories and the gender factor has 2 categories. For the rest of style factors including pitch, speaking speed, and volume, we extract the value of style factors from speech with signal processing tools and divide speech into 3 categories (high/normal/low) according to the proportion. Considering that the style of speech can be described in natural language, we ask experts to write style prompts for each category. To further augment the style prompts, we utilize SimBERT to generate more style prompts with similar semantics. The speech and the corresponding prompt describing the same style and content are used as paired data in our dataset.</p>
<p> Since there could be a gap between the synthesized speech and the real speech, besides the dataset mentioned above (denoted as synthesized version), we also construct a dataset (denoted as real version) with real speech data from LibriTTS by similar construction process. Due to the lack of emotion in LibriTTS, the real version of PromptSpeech only has 4 style factors. As shown in the table below, we split both versions of PromptSpeech into training sets and test sets, which are released in public. The experiments are conducted on PromptSpeech to verify the effectiveness of PromptTTS.</p>
